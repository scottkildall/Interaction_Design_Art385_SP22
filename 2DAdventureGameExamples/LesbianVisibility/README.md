### Overview

The Lesbian Visibility Maze Game allows the user to navigate a series of rooms 
they must escape, each representing a different way lesbianism exists in media 
representation.

This program uses the p5.play game library and the utilization of state machines, 
conditional logic, classes, animation, collision detection, and micro-interactions, 
to create its immersive maze experience.
